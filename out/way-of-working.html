It&#x27;s impossible to know what the code will look like eventually. Therefore it make sense to sit down with the team and dicuss how to implement the next feature only. This will include how code could potentially be refactored before any new code has been written. But that refactoring should only be on a small scale. Bigger refactors should happen on purpose in intervals instead of just when an obvious need get visible. This allows the developers to keep the code base as simple as possible, as the goal of the refactor is to make the code simpler. This could be done by adding or removing(!) abstractions. I find that a good way of approach this kind of refactoring is to reduce coupling and achieve a reasonable level of cohesion. <!-- --> <a href="Cohesion and Coupling in Software with Examples">Cohesion and Coupling in Software with Examples</a> <!-- --> <!-- --> is a very good article that not only explains which types of coupling and cohesion exist, but also how much cohesion should be strived for.</p></div></div></div><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-2a58e3842b457e66.js" async=""></script><script>(self.__next_f=self.__next_f||[]).push([0])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1:HL[\"/_next/static/media/c9a5bc6a7c948fb0-s.p.woff2\",{\"as\":\"font\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n2:HL[\"/_next/static/css/95454efb9aacbce2.css\",{\"as\":\"style\"}]\n0:\"$L3\"\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"4:HL[\"/_next/static/css/e4e54e349431bea1.css\",{\"as\":\"style\"}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"5:I{\"id\":7948,\"chunks\":[\"272:static/chunks/webpack-2a58e3842b457e66.js\",\"971:static/chunks/fd9d1056-a99b58d3cc150217.js\",\"596:static/chunks/596-9d43875837bd0b65.js\"],\"name\":\"default\",\"async\":false}\n7:I{\"id\":6628,\"chunks\":[\"272:static/chunks/webpack-2a58e3842b457e66.js\",\"971:static/chunks/fd9d1056-a99b58d3cc150217.js\",\"596:static/chunks/596-9d43875837bd0b65.js\"],\"name\":\"\",\"async\":false}\n8:I{\"id\":7767,\"chunks\":[\"272:static/chunks/webpack-2a58e3842b457e66.js\",\"971:static/chunks/fd9d1056-a99b58d3cc150217.js\",\"5"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"96:static/chunks/596-9d43875837bd0b65.js\"],\"name\":\"default\",\"async\":false}\n9:I{\"id\":7920,\"chunks\":[\"272:static/chunks/webpack-2a58e3842b457e66.js\",\"971:static/chunks/fd9d1056-a99b58d3cc150217.js\",\"596:static/chunks/596-9d43875837bd0b65.js\"],\"name\":\"default\",\"async\":false}\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"3:[[[\"$\",\"link\",\"0\",{\"rel\":\"stylesheet\",\"href\":\"/_next/static/css/95454efb9aacbce2.css\",\"precedence\":\"next\"}]],[\"$\",\"$L5\",null,{\"buildId\":\"wSRk7-CtPkoyCOz4TsBV6\",\"assetPrefix\":\"\",\"initialCanonicalUrl\":\"/way-of-working\",\"initialTree\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"way-of-working\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{}]}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],\"initialHead\":[false,\"$L6\"],\"globalErrorComponent\":\"$7\",\"children\":[null,[\"$\",\"html\",null,{\"lang\":\"en\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"body\",null,{\"className\":\"__className_e66fe9\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"layout_page__ZPT7X\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"layout_wrapper__zNuca\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"$L8\",null,{\"parallelRouterKey\":\"children\",\"segmentPath\":[\"children\"],\"loading\":\"$undefined\",\"loadingStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"hasLoading\":false,\"error\":\"$undefined\",\"errorStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"template\":[\"$\",\"$L9\",null,{}],\"templateStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"notFound\":[[\"$\",\"title\",null,{\"children\":\"404: This page could not be found.\"}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"style\":{\"fontFamily\":\"system-ui,\\\"Segoe UI\\\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\\\"Apple Color Emoji\\\",\\\"Segoe UI Emoji\\\"\",\"height\":\"100vh\",\"textAlign\":\"center\",\"display\":\"flex\",\"flexDirection\":\"column\",\"alignItems\":\"center\",\"justifyContent\":\"center\"},\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"style\",null,{\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}\"}}],[\"$\",\"h1\",null,{\"className\":\"next-error-h1\",\"style\":{\"display\":\"inline-block\",\"margin\":\"0 20px 0 0\",\"padding\":\"0 23px 0 0\",\"fontSize\":24,\"fontWeight\":500,\"verticalAlign\":\"top\",\"lineHeight\":\"49px\"},\"children\":\"404\"}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"style\":{\"display\":\"inline-block\"},\"children\":[\"$\",\"h2\",null,{\"style\":{\"fontSize\":14,\"fontWeight\":400,\"lineHeight\":\"49px\",\"margin\":0},\"children\":\"This page could not be found.\"}]}]]}]}]],\"notFoundStyles\":[],\"childProp\":{\"current\":[\"$\",\"$L8\",null,{\"parallelRouterKey\":\"children\",\"segmentPath\":[\"children\",\"way-of-working\",\"children\"],\"loading\":\"$undefined\",\"loadingStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"hasLoading\":false,\"error\":\"$undefined\",\"errorStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"template\":[\"$\",\"$L9\",null,{}],\"templateStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"notFound\":\"$undefined\",\"notFoundStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"childProp\":{\"current\":[\"$La\",[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"page_wayOfWorking__MTgpg\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h1\",null,{\"className\":\"page_title__rsu00\",\"children\":\"Way of working\"}],[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"className\":\"page_introText__HpEbC\",\"children\":\"On this page, I'll describe very briefly the ideal development situation I'd like to work in.

# About me

My name is Jan-Gerke (but only my family uses that name, just say Jan) and I’m
a passionate front-end engineer. I grew up and started my career in Karlsruhe,
Germany. In 2016, I moved to Australia to further refine both my English and
programming skills, working full-time. A few years later, I discovered my love
for open source code when working remotely for the University of Oslo.

Since I started working with code, my primary focus has been on enabling code
maintainability, simplicity, and scalability (read through my “way of
working”). It's crucial to recognize that fostering a successful product or
company involves more than just technical aspects. Elements such as company
culture, effective communication, and knowledge sharing play pivotal roles.

The last two years I've spend my time learning about how to improve product
quality from more angles than just writing quality code, e.g. the original,
proper agile concepts, organisational change management, the background behind
good practices (their origin and when not to use them) and development team
management. See my <Link href="/way-of-working">Way of working</Link>

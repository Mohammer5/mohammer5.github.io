        On this page, I&apos;ll describe very briefly the ideal development
        situation I&apos;d like to work in. This will cover code-related topics
        but also team work and organizing tasks.

        Overall I think that Martin Fowler&apos;s blog covers a lot of ideas I
        align with, here are some examples:

      <h2>Do not reinvent the wheel</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of falling into the {' '}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here#In_computing">&quot;NIH Syndrom&quot;</a>
        {' '}trap, we should rely on FOSS solutions for problems that have already been
        solved. This way we won&apos;t have the maintenance burden of
        keeping the solutions alive or improving them while reaping the benefits of
        improvements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Code should only be written for domain-specific problems that can&apos;t be
        addressed by using public solutions and then composed with the
        available tools mentioned above. This way, the codebase stays as small as
        possible, and maintenance remains at a minimum.
      </p>

      <h2>Simplicity is the key</h2>
      <p>
        Simplicity is the key to maintainable, scalable, and usable software.
        This principle applies not only to code and architecture but also to
        user interfaces, documentation, and communication. Regarding
        importance, I follow the{' '}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better#New_Jersey_style">&quot;New Jersey Style&quot;</a>
        {' '}model of software design, at least in parts â€” especially &quot;Simplicity
        is the most important consideration in a design.&quot; However, I believe
        that the interface should be as simple as possible, as the user interface
        must be as accessible as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        The perception of the software by the target audience can make the
        difference between success and losing to a competitor. Therefore, it&apos;s
        necessary to provide an intuitive user interface so that users don&apos;t have
        to think about how to accomplish what they want to do. They should be
        able to just do it.
      </p>

      <h3>Simple software</h3>
      <p>
        Simple software is easy to maintain because it is easy to understand
        how it works and where to find the necessary code. The following text
        can be found on{' '}
        <a href="https://suckless.org/philosophy/">suckless.org/philosophy</a>
        {' '} and has been slightly adjusted by me:
      </p>
        
      <blockquote cite="https://suckless.org/philosophy/">
        We focus on simplicity, clarity and frugality. Our philosophy is about
        keeping things simple, minimal and usable. Unfortunately, the tendency
        for complex, error-prone and slow software seems to be prevalent in the
        present-day software industry. We intend to prove the opposite with our
        software.  
      </blockquote>
        
      <p>
        The user interface should be simple enough that it can be used
        intuitively by inexperienced users (e.g., the older demographic), while
        power users can navigate and interact efficiently and effortlessly.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        Designing simple and elegant software is far more difficult than
        allowing ad-hoc or over-ambitious features to obscure the code over
        time. However, one has to pay this price to achieve reliability and
        maintainability. Furthermore, minimalism results in reasonable and
        attainable goals. I strive to maintain minimalism and clarity to drive
        development to completion.
      </p>

      <h4>Features and rejecting feature requests</h4>
      <p>
        Features should only be added when necessary. The following quote
        summarizes my perspective perfectly:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        we don&apos;t want to blindly add features just because. We
        want to add them if we feel they are useful and pass the benefit versus
        cost calculation. A new feature doesn&apos;t just mean writing some
        code and merging it; it also means testing, maintaining and supporting
        it and considering it whenever another new feature comes up. Also,
        quite often specific usecases can be realized with different
        solutions.<br />
        (<a href="https://github.com/i3/i3/issues/2107#issuecomment-238251240">source</a>)
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Software design</h4>
      <p>
        Designing the code and its architecture follows the evolutionary design
        philosophy. It&apos;s impossible to know what the code will look like
        eventually. Therefore, it makes sense to sit down with the team and
        discuss how to implement the next feature only. This will include how
        the code could potentially be refactored before any new code has been
        written. But that refactoring should only be on a small scale. Bigger
        refactors should happen on purpose at intervals instead of just when an
        obvious need becomes visible. This allows the developers to keep the codebase
        as simple as possible, as the goal of the refactor is to make the code
        simpler. This could be achieved by adding or removing(!) abstractions. I find
        that a good approach to this kind of refactoring is to reduce coupling and
        achieve a reasonable level of cohesion.{' '}
        <a href="Cohesion and Coupling in Software with Examples">Cohesion and
        Coupling in Software with Examples</a> {' '}is a very good article that
        not only explains the types of coupling and cohesion that exist but
        also how much cohesion should be strived for.

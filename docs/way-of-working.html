<p><strong>This page is still <u>work in progress</u>! Some sections and all chapters haven&#x27;t
been completed yet. Having said that, I think this already paints a somewhat
clear picture of how I like to work</strong></p>
<p>On this page, I&#x27;ll describe very briefly the ideal development
situation I&#x27;d like to work in. This will cover code-related topics
but also team work and organizing tasks. I have two main focuses:
Firstly I want to maximize business results, secondly I want to equally
maximize employee satisfaction. In my opinion, it&#x27;s not just possible to
achieve both, the latter is actually very good for the former! Happy employees
work better. Happy employees are happy (this tautology is on purpose!)</p>

<h2>Development</h2>
<h3>Do not reinvent the wheel</h3>
<p>Instead of falling into the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here#In_computing">&quot;NIH Syndrom&quot;</a>
trap, we should rely on FOSS solutions for problems that
have already been solved. This way we won&#x27;t have the maintenance burden of
keeping the solutions alive or improving them while reaping the benefits of
improvements.</p>
<p>Code should only be written for domain-specific problems that can&#x27;t be
addressed by using public solutions and then composed with the available tools
mentioned above. This way, the codebase stays as small as possible, and
maintenance remains at a minimum.</p>
<h3>Simplicity is the key</h3>
<p>Simplicity is the key to maintainable, scalable, and usable software. This
principle applies not only to code and architecture but also to user
interfaces, documentation, and communication. Regarding importance, I follow
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better#New_Jersey_style">&quot;New Jersey
Style&quot;</a> model
of software design, at least in parts — especially &quot;Simplicity is the most
important consideration in a design.&quot; However, I believe that the interface
should be as simple as possible, as the user interface must be as accessible as
possible.</p>
<p>The perception of the software by the target audience can make the difference
between success and losing to a competitor. Therefore, it&#x27;s necessary to
provide an intuitive user interface so that users don&#x27;t have to think about how
to accomplish what they want to do. They should be able to just do it.</p>
<h3>Simple software</h3>
<p>Simple software is easy to maintain because it is easy to understand how it
works and where to find the necessary code. The following text can be found on
<a href="suckless.org/philosophy">suckless.org/philosophy</a> and has been slightly
adjusted by me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We focus on simplicity, clarity and frugality. Our philosophy is about
keeping things simple, minimal and usable. Unfortunately, the tendency for
complex, error-prone and slow software seems to be prevalent in the
present-day software industry. We intend to prove the opposite with our
software.<br/>
<a href="https://suckless.org/philosophy/">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The user interface should be simple enough that it can be used intuitively by
inexperienced users (e.g., the older demographic), while power users can
navigate and interact efficiently and effortlessly.</p>
<p>Designing simple and elegant software is far more difficult than allowing
ad-hoc or over-ambitious features to obscure the code over time. However, one
has to pay this price to achieve reliability and maintainability. Furthermore,
minimalism results in reasonable and attainable goals. I strive to maintain
minimalism and clarity to drive development to completion.</p>
<h3>Software design</h3>
<p>Designing the code and its architecture follows the evolutionary design
philosophy. It&#x27;s impossible to know what the code will look like eventually.
Therefore, it makes sense to sit down with the team and discuss how to
implement the next feature only. This will include how the code could
potentially be refactored before any new code has been written. But that
refactoring should only be on a small scale. Bigger refactors should happen on
purpose at intervals instead of just when an obvious need becomes visible. This
allows the developers to keep the codebase as simple as possible, as the goal
of the refactor is to make the code simpler. This could be achieved by adding
or removing(!) abstractions. I find that a good approach to this kind of
refactoring is to reduce coupling and achieve a reasonable level of cohesion.
<a href="https://thevaluable.dev/cohesion-coupling-guide-examples/">Cohesion and Coupling in Software with
Examples</a> is a very
good article that not only explains the types of coupling and cohesion that
exist but also how much cohesion should be strived for.</p>
<a name="management"></a>
<h2>Management</h2>
<p>Managing software development is often thought of as a very straight forward
process. Executes define the strategy, managers plan, UI/UX design, developers
implement and, if exiting, QA tests.</p>
<p>This simplified version of what software development could look like (and often
it does look like that) neglects many aspects which ensures that realizing any
potential is very limited. On the one hand this process excludes those people
with detailed knowledge about the software from defining strategy or helping
planing: The developers, the UI/UX team and the QA team. On the other hand this
process outright ignores the human aspect of team dynamics. How do we make
decisions? How do we ensure that everyone is (or at least can) heard without
having to fear repercussions?</p>
<h3>Solution-oriented problem solving</h3>
<p>Many job application have a specific requirement: &quot;Solution-oriented approach&quot;.
The issue with this term is that it is very vague. From what I&#x27;ve seen so far,
most people seem to think that it means you should not think about problems too
much and rather &quot;just&quot; find a solution that works. In practice this often leads
to poor decisions with solve the problem only on the surface and, even worse,
introduce new problems which are often not recognized as they&#x27;re quite hard to
see.</p>
<p>The way I see it is that focussing on solutions is often the wrong way. Of
course focusing on the problem only doesn&#x27;t help either as then there won&#x27;t
be any solution whatsoever. But the trick is to define the problem very
clearly, then define equally clearly how we can know whether we solved the
problem and - if possible - how well. This will serve as a basis for finding
and triaging different solutions. It is very important though to try to find
the potential downsides of every solution to be able to properly evaluate the
cost/benefit ratio as best as possible.</p>
<p>This kind of decision making process takes time, and in my opinion rightfully
so. Immature decision will cost the business a lot more time and money than the
extra time spent to find a proper solution.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-oriented_development">&quot;Problem-oriented
development&quot;</a>
paradigm has some good ideas (I understand that the name is meant to represent
a countermovement to the process I describe above, but I think the name is
chosen equally poorly):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Investigating the structure of organisational problems as addressed by
Software Engineering;</li>
<li>Providing formalisms for modelling and representing problems;</li>
<li>Providing guidance and frameworks for problem analysis and decomposition;</li>
<li>Defining techniques for formally justifying solutions (e.g. by associating
problem components with solution components);</li>
<li>Supporting knowledge reuse during problem analysis (e.g. through problem
patterns).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Decisions should be reached through inclusion,<br/>The decision-making process must be explicit</h3>
<p>When it comes to business decisions and strategy, those with the best knowledge
are those at the bottom: the developers, the designers, the researchers, the QA
team, etc. They work on the product, they work with the users and they see
flaws and misdirection directly. A top-down hierarchy (which includes &quot;flat
hierarchies&quot;) all suffer from the same problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>executives don&#x27;t set strategy. Not even the CEO sets strategy. Why? Because
it&#x27;s an illusion to believe you can enforce a strategy. [...]
command-and-control is not very efficient for knowledge workers, because of
the fundamental problem that for any given situation, the people who know the
most about it are the people at the bottom, not the people at the top.<br/>
<a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201909">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the main objective is to make profit, it is in the interest of the founders,
owners and shareholders to include everyone in the decision making process and
it&#x27;s equally important to define the decision making process explicitly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[To] strive for a structureless group is as useful, and as
deceptive, as to aim at an &quot;objective&quot; news story, &quot;value-free&quot; social science,
or a &quot;free&quot; economy. A &quot;laissez faire&quot; group is about as realistic as a
&quot;laissez faire&quot; society; the idea becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the
lucky to establish unquestioned hegemony over others. […] For everyone to have
the opportunity to be involved in a given group and to participate in its
activities the structure must be explicit, not implicit. The rules of
decision-making must be open and available to everyone, and this can happen
only if they are formalized.<br/>
<a href="https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Communication is the key</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile manifesto</a> has four values, of which
the first one is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This already indicates how important communication is. One of the original
authors of the manifesto even talked about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we talked about the Agile Manifesto and laid out the four value
statements, with most of those value statements, we didn&#x27;t care very much
about what order they came in. But we did have an opinion about the first
one: which is &quot;Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools&quot;. To me
that crystallized a very important part of what agile thinking is about.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Meetings</h3>
<p>Meetings are expensive and - if not done properly - just a waste of time for
most of the participants. It&#x27;s tricky to do them right and ideally everyone is
educated about how meetings should be done. Keep them short. When discussions
start, stop them, arrange a follow-up meeting, if possible right after the
meeting. Takes notes and make them public. Only do meetings when necessary. The
following quote summarizes it perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most efficient meeting is no meeting. Let&#x27;s start with what should be
obvious by now: sometimes you don&#x27;t need a meeting at all. For example, status
updates almost always are better delivered in some written medium (like email)
that can be retained for future reference, and skimmed (or ignored) faster than
people can speak. Alas, skipping meetings doesn&#x27;t solve every problem, or else
remote work would be a lot easier for everyone.<br/>
<!-- -->[...]<br/>
<!-- -->Remember: every minute costs multiple person-minutes. Imagine a meeting where a
manager is presenting to 9 people. That costs 1+9 person-minutes per minute. A
single one-hour meeting costs you 10 hours of employee salaries! With modern
tech employees, that adds up really, really fast. You need to spend it wisely.
[...] As a meeting trends away from a presentation and toward group discussion,
efficiency drops fast. Almost always, a discussion will be dominated by 2-3
people, leaving the others to sit and get bored.<br/>
<a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20201123">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Adressing bugs before features</h3>
<p>Getting rid of all bugs before features is a ridiculously difficult task. I&#x27;d
wager to say that it&#x27;s even close to impossible for existing projects that
have accumulated hundrets or thousands of bug tickets. That&#x27;s why it has to be
done properly right from the start.</p>
<p>A very promising approach is the
<a href="https://lostgarden.home.blog/2008/05/20/improving-bug-triage-with-user-pain/">Bug Triage with User Pain</a>.
This approach fits very well into the agile way of working as &quot;<em>it is about
empowering people, not managing them</em>&quot;.</p>
<h3>Features and rejecting feature requests</h3>
<p>Features should only be added when necessary. The following quote summarizes my
perspective perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we don&#x27;t want to blindly add features just because. We want to add them if we
feel they are useful and pass the benefit versus cost calculation. A new
feature doesn&#x27;t just mean writing some code and merging it; it also means
testing, maintaining and supporting it and considering it whenever another
new feature comes up. Also, quite often specific usecases can be realized
with different solutions.<br/>
